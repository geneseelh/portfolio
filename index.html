                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>As a Psychology graduate, I worked with students in grades K-12 developing lectures for the Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) Project. This brought me a lot of satisfaction being that I was able to work with others, create plans, and make a real difference. Wanting to broaden my opportunities and create even bigger projects, I enrolled in a computer science course and enjoyed it so much that I switched career paths to pursue Software Development!</p>
                    <p>I am now a student at Thinkful and extremely passionate about growing my skills. Being both a logical and creative individual who also loves working in teams, I couldn't be happier with my decision!</p>
                    <p>When I'm away from my computer, you can usually find me:</p>
